### <i>Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious </i>
* This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. 
* May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line.
* It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.
